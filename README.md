# InformationRetrieval
Implements TF-IDF algorithm in C to rank sets of text files according to their relevancy to a search query.

## TODO List:
#### Finish rank()
    - [X] Split up calculating tf-idf into different function
    - [ ] Sort the list of relevancy scores and thus, sort doc_ids
        - [ ] Implement sort using qsort()
#### Finish train()
    - [ ] Maybe method to read file?
